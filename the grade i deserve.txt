So, I think the grade I deserve is a 7. It managed not all, but most. I needed some help, but got it in the end. 
Frankly, I think that by just using it (after an introduction like this) it will become easy to enjoy all te possibilities. 

Some terminal shots followed by screenshots

Speaking to myself don't forget first:

1. add --all :/
2. Manager@bl8vbox:~/example2/NorthPacific$ git commit -m "picture in read
3. manager@bl8vbox:~/example2/NorthPacific$ git push
(or pull first)
