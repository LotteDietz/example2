So, I think the grade I deserve is a 7. It managed not all, but most. I needed some help, but got it in the end. 
Frankly, I think that by just using it (after an introduction like this) it will become easy to enjoy all te possibilities. 

Some terminal shots followed by screenshots

Speaking to myself don't forget first:

1. add --all :/
2. Manager@bl8vbox:~/example2/NorthPacific$ git commit -m "picture in read
3. manager@bl8vbox:~/example2/NorthPacific$ git push
(or pull first)

example of resulting Terminal message

########## I did not find a way to inlcude the screenshot - they are available seperately see attempt below

manager@bl8vbox:~/git$ echo '![screenshot1](Screenshot from 2016-01-22 11:22:54.png)' >> 'the grade i deserve'.txt
manager@bl8vbox:~/git$ git add --all :/
manager@bl8vbox:~/git$ git push
warning: push.default is unset; its implicit value is changing in
Git 2.0 from 'matching' to 'simple'. To squelch this message
and maintain the current behavior after the default changes, use:

  git config --global push.default matching

To squelch this message and adopt the new behaviour now, use:

  git config --global push.default simple

When push.default is set to 'matching', git will push local branches
to the remote branches that already exist with the same name.

In Git 2.0, Git will default to the more conservative 'simple'
behavior, which only pushes the current branch to the corresponding
remote branch that 'git pull' uses to update the current branch.

See 'git help config' and search for 'push.default' for further information.
(the 'simple' mode was introduced in Git 1.7.11. Use the similar mode
'current' instead of 'simple' if you sometimes use older versions of Git)
